The Signal
Restoring the Human Premium to the Global Web

What it is
The Signal is a human trust layer for the internet. It verifies human-authored content, labels provenance, and makes authentic work easy to find, rank, and license.

The problem
- Automated content overwhelms human work and collapses trust.
- Users cannot tell genuine recommendations from automated persuasion.
- Creators lose visibility, income, and reputation in a synthetic flood.

The solution
- Privacy-preserving human authorship proofs with device-bound signing.
- Clear origin labels: Human-Authored, Human-Guided, Machine-Generated.
- Distribution-first: browser overlays and creator plugins before a premium human-only search surface.

How it works
- Creator signs content at creation using CMS and IDE plugins.
- Proofs are attached as C2PA-compatible provenance manifests.
- The Signal index and overlays surface verified work across the web.

Why now
- Generative content volume is outpacing human discovery.
- Platforms and regulators are demanding stronger provenance and trust controls.

Business model
- Enterprise API for verified indexes, compliance, and trust scoring.
- Platform partnerships and revenue share for verified distribution.
- Sponsored placements (non-tracking, verified only).
- Creator subscriptions later, after measurable distribution gains.

Go-to-market wedge
- Launch with a browser extension and creator plugins.
- Target journalists, researchers, and developers first.
- Partner with CMS and platform ecosystems to scale verification quickly.

2026 roadmap
- Q2: Extension + CMS/IDE signing plugins, seed 100,000 verified sources.
- Q3: Enterprise API and licensing marketplace.
- Q4: Premium human-only search experience.
